Course Description CDEV2000 Creating Your Career: Employability for the Future enables students to critically refect   on their current employability trajectory, identifying where they may need to develop or enhance      their employability in alignment with their prospective employers, and developing career artefacts in preparation for   job applications. In doing so, CDEV2000   covers four   key topics:

· Understanding yourself to enhance the development of your employability;
· Using career development competencies to create effective career-seeking artefacts; and

Course Aims 
Creating Your Career: Employability for the Future aims to empower students with the knowledge,   skills   and   capabilities   to   plan, engage   in   and   critically   refect   on   career   opportunities   and   their career more broadly. It prepares students for the world of work by   developing   a   deeper understanding   of   recruitment   practices, expectations   of   professionals   across   a   range   of industries   and   the   opportunities   that   exist   now   and   into   the   future. Students   learn   about employability   skills   and   their   own   values   and   refect   on   how   they   can   incorporate   and   articulate   these   in   relation   to   their   own   future   career   vision.
